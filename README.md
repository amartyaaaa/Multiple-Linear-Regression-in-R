# Multiple-Linear-Regression-in-R
The ML model is of a Multiple Linear Resgression. It has a dataset of 50 startups whose Profit (dependent variable) is based on multiple independent vairable. The model uses Backward elimination method to find out the most statistically significant variable which influences the Profit most.

Multiple regression is an extension of simple linear regression. It is used when we want to predict the value of a variable based on the value of two or more other variables. The variable we want to predict is called the dependent variable (or sometimes, the outcome, target or criterion variable). The variables we are using to predict the value of the dependent variable are called the independent variables (or sometimes, the predictor, explanatory or regressor variables).
Multiple regression also allows you to determine the overall fit (variance explained) of the model and the relative contribution of each of the predictors to the total variance explained.
